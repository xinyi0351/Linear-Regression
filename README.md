# Linear-Regression
GR5205 at Columbia University

It's a linear regression course from an applied angle. In this repository, I upload notes on important topics and a few important assignments I've done. Most assignment is about how to test an assumption through simulations. The lecture was given from a completely new angle for linear regression. Little deduction has involved. Lectures were given from single variable to multiple variables. 

### Topics for the course

1. Different objective functions to achieve linear regression.
2. Inference and prediction on coefficients and differents between the two.
3. Estimator evaluation. Diagnoses. 
4. Four assumptions doing linear regression but what should we do if the assumptions are broken.
5. Simultaneous inference including Bonferroni, Hack and traditional Pointwise. ANOVA is mentioned for nest model.
6. Dealing with high demensional data with variable selection (AIC, BIC, Forward/Backward selection) and cross validation.
7. Directed Acycli Graphs (DAGs).

### Topics for the assignments

1. Two samples about simple linear regression.
2. Bootstrap & Categorical data (Logistics Regression) with pulsar star prediction.
3. Simulation and model interpreting.
4. Modeling with DAG
5. High demensional regression and Instrumental Variables
